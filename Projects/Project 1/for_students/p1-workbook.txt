[X] correct P1 Canvas Assignment submission on time [none]: 
[X] completed p1-workbook.txt in the for_student folder correctly [none]: 
[X] clear explanations in p1-workbook.txt [none]: 
[X] Drawing the track as a single simple curve (cardinal spline) that interpolates the control points [tr-01-01]: When the box is checked the simple track is deawn with cardinal spline
[X] Train goes around the track correctly ('evenly in parameter space' - continuous looping motion) [tr-01-01]: while the slider is moving the train goes around evenly
[X] The interface still works (the track can be moved and the run slider works, even while the train is in motion) [tr-01-01]: This is working with previous requirements
[X] Train has a front [tr-01-01]: front detailed by the yellow light triangle like in the demo one
[X] Train points in the right direction as it goes around the track [tr-01-01]: the yellow triangle is always at the front
[X] Train direction and motion is correct even as points are added/removed [tr-01-01]: adding points and removing them doesnt stop the train
[X] Default track configuration shows off arc length (train should speed up and slow down if arc length parameterization is turned off or not implemented) [tr-01-01]: when the checkbox for arc length is unchecked this happerns.
[X] Arc Length parameterization (train goes at a relatively constant speed as it goes around the track, no matter what the control point spacing is). You must add a checkbox to turn this on and off. This one is hard, but it enables several of the other things, so it is actually worth a lot [tr-01-01]: when checked this functions as expected
[X] Rail Ties drawn perpendicular to track [tr-01-01]: brown perpendicularlines  
[X] Rail Ties drawn with correct spacing (this is simple once you have arc-length [tr-01-01]: evenly spaced. if more is added or removed it happens at the very end of the track
[X] Parallel rails [tr-01-01]: Two lines parallel when the basic track is not checked
[X] Multiple cars all of them centered on the track [tr-01-01]: 3 cars following behing 
[X] Multiple cars that are fixed distance apart) [tr-01-01]: evenly spaced using arc length
[ ] Trucked wheels (requires keeping the pairs of wheels the correct distance apart and on the track, and having the train car positioned appropriately - this is only for people who are into trains and appreciate this detail) [tr-01-01]: I do not understand what this is asking so i will not be doing it
[ ] Slider to control tension [tr-01-01]: This consistantly bricked my live server
[ ] Switchable B-Splines [tr-01-01]: I could not figure this out
[X] Smoke [tr-01-01]: light grey circles appear and fade away following behind the trian. I found it very interesting how it changed the smoke survival time when i moved it to its own seperate draw function
[X] Scenery [tr-01-01]: trees appear in random places
[X] Scenery adapts to the track [tr-01-01]: trees will be "cut down" to make room for tracks
