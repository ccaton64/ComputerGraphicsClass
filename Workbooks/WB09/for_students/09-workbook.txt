[X] completed 09-workbook.txt in the for_student folder correctly [none]: 
[X] (at least one) texture you made by painting (described in the readme) [none]: I used photoshop and followed this tutorial and changed up some things to make my brick texture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFz6CdR4POU
[X] (at least one) texture you found on the web (described in readme with proper attribution) [none]: https://www.freepik.com/free-ai-image/handcrafted-wooden-decorative-sculpture_94951225.htm Image by freepik
[X] (at least one) a texture you made by taking a picture (described in the readme) [none]: In 09-01-01 I used a picture of a redbull can I cut open to wrap around the object.
[X] identifyable as a real object [09-01-01]: 
[X] texture makes it look like a real object [09-01-01]: 
[X] an appropriate scene (objects, lighting, …) [09-02-01]: 
[X] clear use of mat prop map [09-02-01]: 
[X] material map use explained [09-02-01]: A darker variant is being used to controll the metalness of the sphere
[X] appropriate scene (objects and lighting) [09-03-01]: 
[X] bump map object looks “bump mappy” [09-03-01]: 
[X] confirm bump map is a bump map (1 channel) [09-03-01]: 
[X] normal map object looks “normal mappy” [09-03-01]: 
[X] confirm normal map is a normal map (3 channels) [09-03-01]: 
[X] explaination of how we can see the effects [09-03-01]: look at it from the side
