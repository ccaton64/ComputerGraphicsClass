Please describe the buildings you created in this file 08-06-01.txt

Explain how you made the buildings. 

I made the church from a BufferGeometry big box with a texture plastered on it then added a simple geom roof and simple geom box cross.
the texture was made by AI and then heavily edited because it did not understand how to place stuff in a way that would work.

The tent was made from simple geometry and then added texture to the side
tent texture made in mspaint because i am not an art guy.
